Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, characterized by a special 
shell developed mainly from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into 
two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira 
(hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way the head retracts. There 
are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including 
land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found on most 
continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the 
ocean. Like other amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe air 
and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around 
water.
