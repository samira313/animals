Rabbits are ground dwellers that live in environments ranging from desert 
to tropical forest and wetland. Their natural geographic range in the 
Western Hemisphere encompasses the middle latitudes. In the Eastern 
Hemisphere rabbits are found in Europe, portions of Central and Southern 
Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Sumatra, and Japan. The European rabbit 
(Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been introduced to many locations around the 
world, and all breeds of domestic rabbit originate from the European.

Rabbits are a paraphyletic grouping, and do not constitute a clade, as 
hares (belonging to the genus Lepus) are nested within the Leporidae clade 
and are not described as rabbits. Although once considered rodents, 
lagomorphs diverged earlier and have a number of traits rodents lack, 
including two extra incisors. Similarities between rabbits and rodents 
were once attributed to convergent evolution, but studies in molecular 
biology have found a common ancestor between lagomorphs and rodents and 
place them in the clade Glires.
