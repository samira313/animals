Rabbits are a paraphyletic grouping, and do not constitute a clade, as 
hares (belonging to the genus Lepus) are nested within the Leporidae clade 
and are not described as rabbits. Although once considered rodents, 
lagomorphs diverged earlier and have a number of traits rodents lack, 
including two extra incisors. Similarities between rabbits and rodents 
were once attributed to convergent evolution, but studies in molecular 
biology have found a common ancestor between lagomorphs and rodents and 
place them in the clade Glires.
